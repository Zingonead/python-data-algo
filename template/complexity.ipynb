    "### Complexity and Big O Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity of an algorithm is a measure of the amount of time and/or space required by an algorithm for an input of a given size e.g. N. Unless otherwise stated, the term complexity always refers to the worst-case complexity (i.e. the highest possible time/space taken by the program/algorithm to process an input).\n",
    "In the case of linear search:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The time complexity of the algorithm is `cN` for some fixed constant c that depends on the number of operations we perform in each iteration and the time taken to execute a statement. Time complexity is sometimes also called the running time of the algorithm.\n",
    "2. The space complexity is some constant c' (independent of N), since we just need a single variable position to iterate through the array, and it occupies a constant space in the computer's memory (RAM).\n",
    "\n",
    "Big O Notation: Worst-case complexity is often expressed using the Big O notation. In the Big O, we drop fixed constants and lower powers of variables to capture the trend of relationship between the size of the input and the complexity of the algorithm i.e. if the complexity of the algorithm is `cN^3 + dN^2 + eN + f`, in the Big O notation it is expressed as `O(N^3)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the time complexity of linear search is `O(N)` and its space complexity is `O(1)`."
